          I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to each and
          every one of you for your hard work, dedication, and support during
          our time working together. You are an amazing group of individuals,
          and I feel incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to work
          alongside you.

        <p>
          I have learned so much from each of you, and your teamwork and
          collaboration have been truly inspiring. Your willingness to help and
          support one another has not gone unnoticed, and it has made our work
          together so much more enjoyable and rewarding.

          I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for your
          friendship. You have not only been great colleagues but also great
          friends, and I cherish the memories that we have made together.

          Once again, thank you for all that you do. It has been an honor and a
          pleasure to work with each and every one of you. I wish you all the
          best in your future endeavors, and I hope that our paths will cross
